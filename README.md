## Description:

### Dr. Joey is :
A Psychotherapist Chatbot trying to help his friends through talking freely about their problems so they can listen to themselves and figure out their solutions with Dr. Joey. Dr. Joey as a Chatbot make his friends feel comfortable while talking because he will not judge them like humans do. Users take a personality test so Dr. Joey can define their personality type, and for fun we designed characters to describe their type and can see who looks like him from famous celebrity, movies and series characters. User can follow the progress or delay his / her condition through his history page, which will present his parentage of happiness and sadness and normal status through his session.


### Our goal is:
To be friends with our users and help them through their problems. We suggested mobile application as it is more usable and common to people and comfortable in chatting than a website, and we used API AI website platform to help us in categorizing dialogs, responses and phrases.
